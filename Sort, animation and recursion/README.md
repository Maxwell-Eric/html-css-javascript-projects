## This set of files demonstrates sorting alogrithms, animation and recurstion. 
### Sorting
The bubble sort, selection sort, insert sort and merge sort algorithms are implemented with animation. The number of compares required to complete the sort is displayed.
### Bouncing Ball Animation
The user selects the size and number of balls. The balls bounce around in a contained window.
### Recursion
The user selects a number, n. The nth number of the Fibonacci sequence and n! are displayed.  The Fibonacci sequence implements a hashtable to avoid a program with O(n!) steps.
